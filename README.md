# Industrial AI QC Labeling and Traceability System

> **Smart PCB Quality Control & Traceability Automation System**  
> A fully automated end-to-end solution for PCB labeling, visual inspection, and product traceability using AI, computer vision, and real-time logging.

## Project Overview

This project is a practical industrial automation system built to streamline the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) manufacturing process. It automatically labels each PCB with a QR code, checks its quality using AI, and logs all data for traceability. The result is a faster, smarter, and more reliable quality control system.

## Key Features

### **Automated Labeling System**
- Custom-built labeler for applying 1x2 inch QR code stickers
- QR codes are generated with unique serial numbers
- Accurate and repeatable sticker placement using mechanical guides

### **AI-Powered Quality Control**
- Computer vision-based real-time inspection
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read component part numbers
- Pass/Fail status automatically assigned using a machine learning model

### **Product Traceability**
- Complete lifecycle logging for every PCB
- Public verification available at `verify.stromlabs.tech/qrid`
- Firebase database integration for real-time product records
- 24x7 online product verification for customers and admins

### **Mechanical Automation**
- Conveyor belt with fine-tuned tension control
- IR sensors detect PCB presence for timing and control
- Raspberry Pi is used for controlling the system and also for loading models that help in image detection for QR and product verification using an camera           connected directly to RPI.

## System Architecture

### **Hardware Components**

|      Component           |         Specification                |       Purpose                               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Frame**                | MDF Sunboard + 3D Printed Parts      | Structural body of the system               |
| **Conveyor Motor**       | IG32 Motor + Cytron Driver           | Drives the conveyor belt                    |
| **Conveyor Belt**        | Cotton Fabric with ±15mm adjustment  | Moves PCBs across the system                |
| **Structural Support**   | 8mm Steel Rods + Flange Bearings     | Provides mechanical stability               |
| **Processing Units**     | Raspberry Pi 5 + ESP32               | Handles AI, control logic, and sensors      |
| **Vision System**        | RPi2Cam Module (NoIR)                | Captures images for inspection and scanning |
| **Rejection System**     | Servo motor-based actuator           | Redirects faulty PCBs                       |
| **Detection**            | IR Sensor                            | Triggers events when PCB is detected        |

### **Software Stack**

- **Backend**: Python for model creation , OpenCV for image detection and Firebase for Database management
- **AI/ML**: Custom trained model for PCB detection and TensorFlow or PyTorch for defect detection
- **OCR**: EasyOCR for reading component labels 
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Web Platform**: Hosted on GitHub Pages for now on our custom domain stromlabs.tech
- **Communication**: ESP32 to Raspberry Pi 5 over serial/I2C

## System Workflow

1. **PCB Entry** → Detected by IR sensor  
2. **Conveyor Stops** → Label is applied  
3. **QR Code is Scanned** → Serial number recorded  
4. **AI Quality Inspection**:
    - OCR text verification
    - Visual defect detection
    - Component identification  
5. **Database Logging** → All data stored in Firebase  
6. **Pass/Fail Classification**
7. **Product Routing**:
    - **PASS** → Sent forward on main conveyor
    - **FAIL** → Removed from the converyor belt manually(for now).

## Quality Control Parameters

Each PCB is inspected for the following:

- **Device ID**: Unique product ID assigned 
- **Batch ID**: Tracks production batch for collective product data access
- **Manufacturing Date**: Timestamp for traceability
- **RoHS Compliance**: Environmental compliance status
- **Serial Number**: Encoded in the QR code for direct verification instead of manually entering data
- **Visual Defects**: Detected via custom trained AI model 
- **Component Verification**: Checked using OCR 

## Traceability System

### **Web Verification Platform**
